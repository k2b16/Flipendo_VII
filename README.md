Step 4: Setting up Component Library

Note: If done according to the guide, the component library will be located in the Component_library folder.

To set up the component library, you first have to open KiCAD. Then in the upper menu bar, open Preferences -> Configure Paths... In there first press the + to add a new entry.

As the next step, open Preferences -> Manage Symbol Libraries... There, Press the button shown on the image below, marked by 1 and then in the folder selection window, select all of the files inside Component Library/Symbols directory.

After that, bunch of symbol entries should appear to the symbol library browser.

A very similar thing has to be done with Footprints, except instead of selecting files inside the Footprints directory you must choose all of the .pretty directories in there. Adding Footprint libraries is done in Preferences -> Manage Footprint Libraries...
